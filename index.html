          Peni Parker is a fictional character from Marvel Comics, a superhero and alternative version of Spider-Man. The character is depicted as a 14-year-old high school student who was adopted by Aunt May and Uncle Ben following the death of her father/caretaker. She pilots a psychically-powered mech suit built by her father known as the SP//dr, which is partially controlled by a radioactive spider that also shares a psychic link with her.[1]

Both Peni Parker and SP//dr have made scant appearances in media, with their most prominent being the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, in which the former is voiced by Kimiko Glenn.
